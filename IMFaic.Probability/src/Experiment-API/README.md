# Experimental Branch - API

This branch will be used for exploring the design of the IMFaic.Probability.dll API.

# Is the API going to fix Random?

**Sure, we can say, don't use random, but use distributions instead.**

Oookaaay. Which one?

**Sure, we can think someone looking for random in Probability.dll can look at it and think, oh I can use distributions with all those extension methods instead.**

Or, maybe they will see Bernoulli and friends, and think, nope, no random here.

And, looking somewhere else they will say, oh, there it is! **System.Random!**

# Okay, you have convinced me. What will the Random API look like?

Simpsons - Homer - I don't know.
