# Episodes

This contains all the IMFaic.Probability.Episode*.cs files.

Each IMFaic.Probability.Episode*.cs will contain a Main() method which will be used as the Main() method for IMFaic.Probability.exe.

For example
```
    IMFaic.Probability.Episode04.cs
```
will contain the Main() method that will be used to build
```
    bin\IMFaic.Probability\4.0.0\IMFaic.Probability.exe
```

This allows us to build any episode of this particular fabulous adventure in coding without worrying about which diverging forks we have taken in the road.
