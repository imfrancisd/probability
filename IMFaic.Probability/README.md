# Your mission should you choose to accept it

* Try out the challenges in this fabulous adventures in (probability) coding
* You must use a minimal amount of tools
    * Windows computer (7, 8, or 10)
    * powershell.exe (2, 3, 4, or 5)
    * nuget.exe (any version) and anything you can download from https://www.nuget.org/
* **You cannot change any of the source code, project files, or project directories from Probability.** This (_Impossible Missions Faic Probability_ library) is a clandestine project

* The versions have the form of \<episode\>.\<challenge\>.\<revision\>
    * Versions with the form \<episode\>.0.0 must build a single executable
    * Versions with the form \<episode\>.1.0 must build a single executable and a library that publicly exposes the Probability functionality.
* You can write, generate, copy, or mix source code from Probability with code from IMFaic.Probability, but you must not add, not delete, and not modify any folder or file from the Probability project.
* Follow the way nuget structures packages if you wish to target multiple frameworks.
* You can run tests any way you want, but they must not be included in the output directory described above.
